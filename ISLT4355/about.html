        <h3>About Me!</h3>
        <p>Hello, my name is Taylor Swanigan. I am a current sophomore at the University of Missouri-Columbia. 
            I graduated from St. Louis, MO high school, Rosati-Kain in 2021. 
            Currently, I am pursuing my Bachelors in Science and anticipate graduation in May of 2025. 
            I am on the Pre-Medical track, majoring in Biology with a minor in Psychology.
            I have plans to attend medical school in hopes of becoming a top-neurosurgeon. 
            When I am not studying, I hold the chair as Treasurer for a minority book club at Mizzou 
            and attend biweekly MAPS-Minority Association for Pre-Health Students-meetings.
            I am currently conducting research under Dr. Lei Lei here at Mizzou. We focus on mammalian 
             ovarian reserve formation maintenance, and its associated female reproductive health issues.</p>
        <p>Here is a my favorite quote</p>
        <blockquote>â€œYou are Smart, you are Kind, and you are Important."</blockquote>
