    Hey everyone! My name is Taylor Swanigan. I’m nineteen and pursuing my Bachelors in Science studying Biology on the pre-medical track. I also have a minor in psychology, Though I do not have any previous training in web apps or development training, my dad has been a CIO most of his career. I’ve been briefed with many different terminologies over the years, thanks to him. Throughout this course, I expect to explore the vast world of Web Design and what it has to offer. I have hopes of becoming a neurosurgeon in the near future, but in my free time, I run a crochet business. Touching the surface of Web Design may inspire me to explore CSS and beyond, and possibly run my own website-I don't have one yet! I’d have to say crochet is my favorite hobby, next would be sleep, I enjoy that hobby whenever time allows.
