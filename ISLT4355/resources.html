                <strong>Learning any new hobby can feel intimidating in the beginning.</strong>
            Everything is new, terminology, time invested, money, many factors.
            A hobby is something you love to do. When people ask me about my hobbies, 
            I always say they are my escape away from reality, something to wash away 
            the stresses life can sometimes bring. However, stressing about learning 
            a new hobby is the last thing we want. Luckily you are here and I will 
            help you learn to crochet the easy, stress-free way! If you are still 
            on the fence if this hobby for you, let's first dive into what crochet really is.
            <br><p>Crochet is a yarn craft that consists of only a few basic materials. 
            The good news is that crochet is a pretty inexpensive hobby! 
            When you become more advanced you’ll find yourself at crafting stores 
            frequently… that can add up! To start a project, all you need is a 
            crochet hook and a skein of yarn. We will talk more on this terminology 
            in the ‘materials’ section. Some people confuse crochet with knitting, 
            but they are in fact different. Knitting uses two knitting needles, 
            crochet uses one hook- a whole lot easier! All in all, when you are 
            crocheting, you will be working up a project with your fiber (yarn type), 
            one stitch at a time. The hook part of crochet is straightforward, 
            you put your hook into the previous row you started. In as little as 
            a few hours or even a couple months, you can have your own beanie, 
            washcloth, blanket, etc. in your fingertips.

                <strong>As stated before, you really only need two things to begin 
                your first crochet project- a hook and yarn.</strong> The most you 
                should spend for your first project is around $8! I will note, 
                however, there are additional materials you can purchase when 
                working with more difficult projects. Some of these things 
                include a hook organizer and a few other knicks and knacks 
                that can make crocheting a little easier.
                <br><p>First we can start with the part that interests most people, 
                Yarn! Yarn is the most fun of all the crochet supplies you’ll 
                need because of all the colors, fibers, and weights it comes 
                in. Most new crocheters start with a low cost acrylic yarn, 
                such as Lion Brand. It can be easily found in most craft 
                stores. It holds up quite well, comes in a variety of colors, 
                and as stated, is very affordable. You can use acrylic yarn 
                for hats, scarfs, and winter-ish projects! Wool is another 
                alternative-slightly more expensive. Cotton yarn (my new 
                personal favorite) is another route to venture when purchasing.
                 If you are looking to make clothes for the summer or boho-chic hats, 
                 this is the yarn for you. Yarn comes in a number of weights too. 
                 The weight of the yarn refers to  the thickness of the yarn. 
                 It’s a range from super-fine to super-bulky. I linked a picture for better understanding.

                 <br><p>Next, the last piece you need to start your first project, 
                    the Hook! The hook is an essential piece to starting your project,
                    they too, come in  a number of different sizes. I recommend a 6.5 
                    crochet hook when starting off. You can refer to the picture as 
                    well for a reference. When researching be sure to check if US or 
                    UK terms are used. </p>

                 <br><p>Lastly, you may question where you can find yarn and crochet
                    hooks, the answer is quite a few places. I prefer Joanns and Michaels, 
                    but Amazon, Walmart, and many other places sell supplies that you may
                     need or want. Scissors ARE helpful!</p>

                <strong>You’ve made it to the end of the sections!</strong> It is easy to get lost
                 on Youtube when searching for crochet tutorials. There are a lot 
                 out there.  Here I’ve included YouTube videos that I think will 
                 help you most. You should start by watching the first three videos
                  in order. These videos will properly teach you how to tie a slip 
                  knot, the chain stitch, and single crochet. After, there will 
                  be a few beginner projects you’ll see listed. I will include a 
                  link to a playlist I found on Youtube, the list includes a lot of
                   beginner style patterns (which I would skip until you learn the 
                   basics) and many different stitch tutorials, but there are also 
                   very beginner how-to videos such as “How To Read Crochet Patterns” 
                   and “Crochet Hook Sizes, Gauge and Chaining.”
